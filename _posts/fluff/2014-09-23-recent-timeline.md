## **566 CY**

### A chapel dedicated to Elemental Evil is established at Nulb

> _Its out-of-the-way position was ideal for the fell purposes planned for this settlement. The thickets and marshes around Nulb became the lair and hiding place for bandits, brigands, and all sorts of evil men and monsters alike. The chapel grew into a stone temple as its faithful brought in their ill-gotten tithes. Good folk were robbed, pillaged, enslaved, and worse._

## **569 CY**

### _Battle of Emridy Meadows_ and the _Temple of Elemental Evil_

- Battle of Emridy Meadows

  > _Contingents of men-at-arms and cavalry from_ Furyondy _and_ Veluna _, along with a force of Dwarves from the_ Lortmils _, gnomes from the_ Kron Hills _, and an army of elven archers and spearmen fought together against a vast horde of humanoids (orcs, gnolls, and ogres predominantly) and evil men. The opposing forces met on the grassy fields south of the_ Velverdyva _river several leagues below the city of_ Verbobonc _. The allied forces were closing upon the stronghold of the evil creatures, a huge walled fortress known as the_ Temple of Elemental Evil _, not far from the village of_ Hommlet _, when elven scouts reported that a huge army was approaching from the south._

- Horde of Elemental Evil scattered

  > _After the great slaughter, the army went on to besiege the_ Temple of Elemental Evil _, and it fell in a fortnight. Only a few of the wicked leaders of the Temple managed to escape, and it is suspected that these individuals were responsible for the subsequent kidnapping and total disappearance of the Prince of Furyondy._

- The Prince of Furyondy (Provost of Veluna) goes missing; presumed kidnapped

  <span style="font-size: 65%">(Gygax, "The World of Greyhawk - Fantasy World Setting" (folio), p8)</span>

- Bandits begin riding the roads around Hommlet again

  > _To the good folk of Hommlet, this seemed all too familiar, so they sent word to the Viscount that wicked forces might still lurk therabouts._  
  <span style="font-size: 65%;">(Gygax, T1-4 - "The Temple of Elemental Evil", p5)</span>

- Fellowship of the Torch formed

  > _The group met for the first time in response to a proclamation from Tigran Gellner, who was looking for adventurers to assist in a peremptory strike against a nest of bugbears and a few ogres in the_ Cairn Hills.

## **579 CY**

### Outsiders in Hommlet again and the Campaign begins!

- Outsiders and adventurers begin arriving in Hommlet

  > _This information has been spread throughout the countryside, and the news has attracted outsiders to the village. Who and what these men are, no one can be quite sure. All claim to be bent on slaying monsters and bringing peace and security to Hommlet; but deeds speak louder than words, and lies cloak the true purposes of the malevolent._  
  <span style="font-size: 65%;">(Gygax, T1-4 - "The Temple of Elemental Evil", p5)</span>

- **The _Ordo Septenarius_ is formed** and **the Adventure begins ...**

  > _Expeditions were planned, and at last begun. Maalcyor and Moonglum, with but a glance, confirmed they would be travelling together. The news of wonders and riches being found buried deep beneath Castle Greyhawk -- no-less than the ancient home of Zagyg himself! -- cried out for exploration and discovery..._
  > _The final meeting of the eight (now seven), as they embark on their quest, consists of one final accord: until their lost ally is found, they will henceforth be known as _The Ordo Septenarius_; their rallying cry and their motto: _"Quae erit octo!"_._
