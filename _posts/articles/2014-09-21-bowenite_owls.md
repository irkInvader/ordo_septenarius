## _Figurines of Wondrous Power_

### _Bowenite Owls_
These statuettes share features in common with all _figurines of wondrous power_, namely:

> Each is apparently a statuette of small size; about an inch or so high. When the _figurine_ is tossed down and a command word spoken, however, it becomes a living creature which obeys and serves its owner. If any _figurine_ is destroyed in its statuette form it is forever ruined, all magic is lost, and it has no power. If slain in animal-like form the _figurine_ simply reverts to its statuette conformation and can be used again at a later time as long as the statuette is not broken. <span style="font-size: 65%;">(Gygax, AD&D Dungeon Master's Guide, p. 144)

A _bowenite owl_ becomes a normal-sized owl of various species. It moves with 95% silence. This owl can carry a single message to one, or multiple, recipients. The letter can not be more than a single sheet of parchment.

The message will be delivered by the owl to each addressee in turn, in the order specified in the letter, until all recipients have received the message. The letter, upon being opened or unrolled, will remain a physical manifestation of the original letter for up to 24 hours, at which time it will disintegrate into so much dust.

There are two requirements for the owl to find and reach a recipient:

1. The recipient must possesses one of the matching _bowenite owl_ statuettes.
2. The recipient must be accessible to the owl.
