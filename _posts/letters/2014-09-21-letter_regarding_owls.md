To the members of the _Societas Octonarius_,

I have observed the formation of your fellowship with great interest. I have followed your maturation into a force for weal in this world with growing appreciation. I have been impressed with your charitable works and devotion to loyalty, friendship, and other virtues I hold high.

I am dismayed at the unfortunate events that have befallen your missing compatriot, Timmund. I applaud your current endeavors to locate and liberate him from the forces of Evil. My sources inform me that they intend to use him as a catspaw in their wicked machinations, and this must be stopped.

To this end, I have commissioned these _figurines of wondrous power_ to aid in maintaining the comraderie and single-purpose of your Order. Each of you is granted one of these statuettes, which may be activated by tossing it upon the ground and speaken the command words, "**_Throsglwyddo'r Neges!_**". Upon issuance of this command, the statuette will change it's form to that of an actual owl, and will wait for a written correspondance comprising no more than a single page. Upon such a receipt, it will fly to the addressee, or addressees, post-haste. Due to the nature of its travel, the delivery of this message may take a significant amount of time, and it is very difficult to predict exactly how much. You may safely assume that a period of one or two weeks may pass before the owl returns to you and resumes its statuette form.

Through these _figurines_, I hope that you can share the clues you are sure to discover, as well as update your allies on the progress of your individual efforts.

I feel strongly that you are destined for greatness and glory.

-- a fellow philanthropist
