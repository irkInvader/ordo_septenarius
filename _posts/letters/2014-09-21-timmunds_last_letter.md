Dearest Fellows,

Excellent news! I have discovered a few choice clues as to the location and
disposition of my oldest friend, Thrommel. As you know, he disapeared
suspiciously almost 6 years thence. More than being my oldest and truest
friend and companion, and being instrumental in the formation of our
fellowship, he is, of course, the Crown Prince of Furyondy, Chief Marshal of
the same, and Provost of the Archclericy of Veluna!

It is of the utmost import that he be found and returned to his beloved
fiance, Jolene, daughter of the Plar of Veluna. These two great nations,
joined as such, would certainly form a mighty defense against the forces of
Evil. Certainly, those very same forces, being aware of the danger to their
existence this union would represent, were involved in some way with his
disapearance. (kidnapping, I name it!)

It has come to my attention that a few notable persons from Verbobonc may have
seen him being forcibly taken into the depths of the Gnarley Forest. This does
not bode well, for as you may be aware, Thrommel was instrumental in the
downfall of the forces of Elemental Evil which once grew rampant in that very
same forest.

If these rumors are true, not only may I be one step closer to rescuing my
good friend, but the resurgence of Evil in this part of the Central Flanaess
must be scouted and reported.

Wish me luck, my friends. The Gnarley Forest has a reputation, as we all know.
I will not travel alone, I assure you. Thrommel father has promised me a
retinue of the finest Furyondy has to offer to aid in my investigation. We
will travel in secret, to be sure, so as to hide our intentions from the
forces of Evil. If you endeavor to follow, or wish to offer aid yourself, know
that we will begin in the Village of Hommlet, some scant few leagues south of
Verbobonc proper.

Yours always, your absent comrade,  
the Honorable Squire Timmund
