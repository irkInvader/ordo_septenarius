Dear Fellows,

I just had the most interesting encounter with a travelling tinker. This short, stout merchant was distinguished from others of his like only by his notable van dyke beard, pointed and outlined in grey.

He hewed and hawked me into purchasing a trinket he promised was infused with arcane powers. I write this note as a test, for he tells me this statuette will act as a messsenger to deliver it to whomsoever I address it to. I am skeptical, to say the least, and so will keep this message short.

If this experiment succeeds, and the owlish figurine does indeed transform into a live bird, and furthermore carries this message away (as he insists it will), I will endeavor to keep you informed of my search for my dear Thrommel with further letters.

He warns me that the bird can only carry a single correspondance at a time, and that it must do so physically, albeit as the bird flies, if you'll forgive the obvious turn of phrase. He went on to explain that the bird would not deliver a response, and so I must trust these words find you.

If it returns as he describes, I will continue to detail my quest with further letters in the future.

Yours - Timmund
