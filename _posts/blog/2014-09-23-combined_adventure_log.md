## **579 CY**

### 3 Flocktime (5/3/579)

Timmund purchases a Bowenite Owl from a travelling tinker. He proceeds to send a note to test its function.

### 18 Flocktime (5/18/579)

Timmund sends his first letter via Bowenite Owl to the other members of the Societas Octanarius. It also happens to be his last!

### 20 Wealsun (6/20/579)

A letter from the King of Furyondy, addressed to Timmund's parents, and subsequently shared with the members of the _Societas Octanarius_, explains that Timmund has disappeared without a trace.

An investigation reveals that he was researching many various possibile locations for the missing Prince, including: The ruins of _Castle Greyhawk_, The village of _Hommlet_ in **Verbobonc**, The village of _Orlane_ in the **Grand Duchy of Geoff**, the city of _Lopolla_ in **Ket**, and _Admundfort_ on **Walworth Isle** in the _Nyr Dyv_.

### 1 Richfest (RF/1/579)

The _Societas Octanarius_, as is their custom, departs on a "Festival Adventure" (ie. a camping trip to the foothills of the Cairn Hills). This trip, however, is with a heavy heart. The disappearance of Timmund weighs heavily on each of them.

### 2 Richfest (RF/2/579)

The _Societas Octanarius_, still on holiday, are visited by a giant Great Grey Owl. It was carrying a packing crate and a letter from a mysterious benefactor, signed "a fellow philanthropist". In the box are a set of 7 (of 8) "Bowenite Owls".

Immediately after receiving their individual owl figurines, the members receive the note and letters sent previously by Timmund.

### 4 Richfest (RF/4/579)

The _Ordo Septenarius_ is formed and departs on their various excursions:

- Maalcyor and Moonglum, with henchmen in tow, proceed to the ruins of _Castle Greyhawk_.

- Corvyn, Hari, and Kafka proceed south along the _Selintan River_, on their way to _Hommlet_. They procure a ride on a Rhennee river barge for the journey.

- Kassy has trouble deciding who to join, but eventually decides to try to follow Maalcyor and Moonglum. After a short misadventure, Kassy, Adin, and a new friend, Naeris, arrive in the town of _Hochoch_, on the borders of the **Grand Duchy of Geoff**.

### 5 Richfest (RF/5/579)

Kassy, Adin, and Naeris join an expedition to free the village of _Orlane_ from whatever Evil besets it. They are led by **Sir Moonbrook**, an Elf Paladin of _Heironeous_ from the **Duchy of Ulek**.

### 7 Richfest (RF/7/579)

Corvyn, Hari, and Kafka arrive at _One Ford_. They choose to stay at the _Grapes and Lantern Hostelry_, wherin Kafka picked a pocket and found a tiny, silver bell missing it's clapper.

### 1 Reaping (7/1/579)

Corvyn, Hari, and Kafka stop to make camp along the road to _Narwell_. During the night, a giant Wolf Spider emerges from a nearby copse of trees and a fight ensues. The three companions easily dispatch the creature.

### 3 Reaping (7/3/579)

Kassy, Adin, and Naeris cross swords with their expedition's leader, emerging victorious. During a short rest along the road, Sir Moonbrook was possessed by some Evil presence, as was his squires. The party spared his life, yet the still-possessed Knight attacks the party a second time just before arriving in _Orlane_ and the party is saved from certain death by the local constabulary, though not before valiant Naeris is slain (with his own sword, no less!).
