# Notes

## Races
- No Dragonborn (don't exist on Oerth)
- No Teiflings (don't exist on Oerth)


## Classes
### Barbarians
- **heavily** restricted (don't fit story)
  - as per _Combat_, below, changes may need to be made to _Rage_ feature (duration, etc.)

### Clerics
- restricted from bladed weapons
  - debatable
- Cantrips and 1-3 level spells as written; after that, Deity has much influence
- _Probably_ takes more time for prayers than listed
- I don't know about Domain spells


## Combat
- Single roll for initiative, _every_ round (d6 - as per 1ed AD&D)
- Rounds will be 60 seconds, not 6 - as per 1ed AD&D
  - Many other adjustments may need to be made.
